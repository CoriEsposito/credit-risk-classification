# credit-risk-classification

## Credit Risk Analysis Report

* Purpose of analysis was to analyze the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* Data was based on loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory remarks, total debt, and loan status for each borrower analyzed. 
* Analysis used this data to try to predict whether borrowers were high or low risk using logistic regression.

## Results

* Precision was 100% for low-risk and 84% for high-risk
* Recall was 99% for low-risk and 94% for high risk
* Accuracy was 99%

## Summary

I recommend this model as it performs with presicion and accuracy, more specifically for the low risk which had a significantly higher amount.
